# Tiny Blog
Tiny Blog is meant to be a small simple blogging engine to allow you to quickly setup a new blog without the need of a database, etc.
It's build using .net core 2.1 and uses Razor Pages.
Blog posts are saved to the local file system as JSON files. I drew inspiration for this from Mads Kristensen's project

There are a lot of new features we'd like to add to help improve Tiny Blog so if you're interested in helping feel free to get involved!
